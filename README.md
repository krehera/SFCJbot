##All commands should start with mentioning the bot (@SFCJbot)

commands:

**help** - links to the GitHub page so the user can see the README

**games** - lists the games SFCJbot offers and their shorthand aliases

**alias** - lists the games SFCJbot offers and their shorthand aliases

**queue [game]** - adds you to the queue for [game]

**unqueue [game]** - removes you from the queue for [game]

**afk** - changes your status to afk (so the bot won't ping you)

**here** - changes your status to here (so the bot will ping you)

**match [game]** - pings everyone queued up for [game] that's here. Or use match without mentioning a game to match a random game you're queued for!

**describe [name]** - tells you what games [user] is queued up for. Don't mention them, just type their name.

**set challonge [name]** - tell the bot your Challonge username so it can ping you for pairings when a tournament starts!

mod-only commands:

**addgame [game]** - lets the bot recognize [game] as a valid game. (this command is not working for now.)
